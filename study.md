# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use "this" to reference things and not have to type many characters. It may be easier for the developer to understand what is being refered to in code.

I made that up based on the reading i did for the next question, and MDN.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" can be used to refer to the owner of a function. In other words the object that the function "is a method of". which i think means the object that the function is a part of.

When "this" is used outside an object, or rather, on a page it refers to the page, or object that will use the file.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
a prototype is a separate object linked to it's master object.

a prototype (and its prototype, and so on) may provide a property, when the property of an object is sought after. the property to be used will be the first property found with a matching name. Starting with looking at the properties of the object, then the properties of the objects prototype, then the prototype of the prototype. and so on and so on.
