# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
"This" keyword makes our code more precise. For example, if we use car.model
and also have a global variable "car", this could lead to confusion. I used
the second article in the required reading (JSIS). The analogy that compares
"this" to pronouns was useful in understanding the benefits of using the
keyword.

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is a shortcut that allows you to refer to different elements depending on context. For example, when used inside an object method, "this" refers to the immediate parent object, but when used inside a global function, "this" refers
to the window object. I used the second article in the required reading (JSIS) for my answer.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototypes are objects and functions from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Since every object has a prototype property, all objects inherit properties from their prototypes. I used the online resource w3schools to help m answer.
```
