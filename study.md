## This in Context

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- This mimics the object of where it is called. If its not called within an object then it mirrors the global window within a browser. If it is inside an object then it mirrors the object. If its used in a function then allows for adding placeholders for an objects attribute.-->
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- A prototype can be looked at as a default personality trait in an object that is inheriting it.  A prototype shares inherited attributes for objects to use.
