## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We can use this within an object's function to prevent confusion which can happen when reusing the name of the object (JSIS).
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
this refers to an object's variable name within it's own function (JSIS)
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is an object which is a way to add a variable to a parent object. This enables you to amend the prototype variable so that it affects all parent objects whereas normally you could amend each instance's internal variables one at a time which is not always appropriate (JSIS + husband)
```
