# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md

One reason we use "this" is for precision. If we had a global variable with the
same name as an object then reference an object value we might get the value of
the global variable. I used [JSIS: This] to obtain a reason why "this" is used.

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" refers to a single object and is stored inside of a function. It only stores
the value of the object when the object itself invokes a function. I used [JSIS: This]
to obtain this definition of "this".
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is an object and every object has a prototype. To create an object
prototype you can use the constructor function. You can not add properties and
methods to object prototypes the same way you add them to an object. You have
to add them to the constructor or you can use the prototype property to add
properties or methods to an existing prototype. I used http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_prototypes.asp
to find a definition of Prototypes.
