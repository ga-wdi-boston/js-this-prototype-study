## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.



```md
We use this in functions. As a precaution in case their may be a global variable
with the same name, using this is a way of making the code less vague, and more
 concise, by pointing directly to the key and correlating value.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be

This is usually used inside of a function or a method, it is typically used
referring to the value an object has previously been declared as.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md

a funtion, it will then gain whatever properties and methods were attached.
