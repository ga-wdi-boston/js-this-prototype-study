# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" heading).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- kind of lke DRY for starters. Not only does it make more sense (now that
jsis is in my life) but it begins to feel more natural in context when you
understand the syntax better. When you are basically explaining a function into
 the code why would you say variableX built into this function and then continue
 to reference variableX when you could essentially be saying "the variable we're
  obviously still talking about" in one word. it makes the overall block of code
  less ambiguos as you read it.

jsis made this clear right away   -->
```

## This is what

In your own words give explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- This is a property given to all functions and refers back to AND holds the
value of the object in the function immediately preceding the use of 'this'. it
is a way to refer to both the object the function is operating with as well as
the value of that object. I think. --!>
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- I'm still a little unclear on prototype, at least less clear than on this
but I think it's going to take some rereading and implementing it in code to
really grasp. But it sounds like  prototype is a special property of all
functions and by using prototype we can refer  the following sentence has both
helped and made it more confusing, but I'm going to reread it until i comprehend
it or die trying :"The ‘prototype’ property points
to the object that will be asigned as the prototype of instances created with
that function when using ’new’." I mostly used jsis for both of these but also
