## This in Context

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" can be used either within a function or method or it can be used globally when used outside of the function or method.

If "this" is used within a function, it always refers to an object that holds the function that uses "this". When it is used outside of a function, it always referes to the global window object.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Every function in JavaScript has prototype property (empty by default).

Assigning prototype property to a function allows us to assing other properties and methods that we can use on different objects later on without specifically assigning the same properties and methods on those new created objects.
