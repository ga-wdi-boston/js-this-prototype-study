## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason to use "this" is to shorten the JavaScript code similar to using a `he` or `she` pronoun in English.  The `this` keyword refers to an object.

Using the `this` keyword allows for more scalable and accurate code as it refers to a specific object.  The `this` object can have global or function scope.
