## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason we would use "this" is to make our code more clear.  If the object name is long the code can look bulky and can become confusing.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
JSIS explains that "this" can be thought of as a shortcut that refers back to the object.  "this" itself does not have a value until the function of the object is excecuted.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype in JS is an object that inherts the properties of other objects.  In JS there is prototype property and prototype attribute.  Prototype property is used when one object inherits properties from another object.  Prototype attribute is the characteristic of the object which describes the object's "parent".  (source: JSIS)
