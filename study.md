## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason we might use "this" is to avoid ambiguity by making sure we are
correctly referring to the current object, instead of perhaps another globally
defined variable with the same name as the object.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" is a keyword in JavaScript which refers to the current object, unless
there is no current object, in which case it refers to the global object (e.g.,
'window' in a web browser).

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

Prototypes are objects. All JavaScript objects have a prototype,
from which they inherit their properties and methods.
