## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We could use "this" to refer to an object that a function belongs to in order to
avoid any global variables with the same name.
```

## This is what

In your own words give explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Also, it allows an object to referto itself and its properties (like using the words
 "I", "me", and "my"). "this" is basically all about context/scope, either global or
 inside an object method.  When a function is called on an object, "this" will be
 set to the object.  If the function does not call on an object, then "this" will refer
 to something global.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is similar to a class in other languages like HTML or CSS. Basically, it allows
for the inheritance/transfer of properties and attributes to child objects in the
same way that multiple ids might have the same properties as a class.
```
