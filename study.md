## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" can remove ambiguity if there is a globally defined variable of the same name/label associated with the current code execution. By using "this" in a function, the referenced subject is well known and specific.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype allows someone to attach properties and methods to an object for later use by other objects. Usually, an object's prototype is not defined and must be done explicity. But once a prototype is defined, it is accessible to any other object that interacts with the prototyped object.
