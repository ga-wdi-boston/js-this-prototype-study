## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- One reason we use 'this' is to avoid conflict with other global objects. There could another global object with the same name, so
by calling 'this' you know exactly which object we are talking about. Source ~ 'Understand JavaScript’s “this” With Clarity, and Master It' -->
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the global object. This helps avoid confusion by specifying the
global object being used when constructing a new object or calling a method. Source ~ MDN: This    -->
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- Every object has prototype properties which can be inherited by other objects.
When an object is created it inherits the property of its prototype but is not an exact copy
of its parent object. It only points to the prototype object but does not contain the actual attributes. Source ~ 'JavaScript Prototype in Plain Language'  -->
```
