## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md

"This" can be used (similar to the way pronouns are used) to help simplify code and limits repetition. It can't be overridden with a global variable of the same name. Using "this" eliminates code ambiguity and enables easier debugging.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is used as a shortcut to refer back to an object in context, or to the "owner" of the function being executed.
"This" doesn't have an assigned value until the object invokes the function where "this" is defined.

```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Every JavaScript function has a prototype property which is empty by default.  You can add methods and properties to a function, enabling inheritance of these methods and properties to other instances of that function.
