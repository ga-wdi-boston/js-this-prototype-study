## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
There may be another variable with the same name(on a global level)
By using this, javascript knows to refer to the object used in the same context
I used JSIS
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a precise way we can use to refer to the object name within the same context. Similar to how we would use a pronoun(such as he) FOLLOWING the name(in this case John) of the person in the same context, we would use this to refer to object name in the same context(which also contains the value of that object)

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
A prototype is like an invisible attachment to an object/variable. That invisible attachment contains a certain set of methods. When an object/variable is created, the properties/values within that object/variable all inherit that invisible attachment. So if we create a variable called myString that has a string value, myString will inherit the methods that are used for a string such as .length and .charAt(). Similarly if we declare a variable called num with a numerical value it will inherit the methods that are used for a number such as .toFixed() and .toExponent
