# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason would be to avoid confusion with variable names.  B/C this used inside of a function will not be confused with a variable of a similar name otuside the function you can be sure you're calling what what was intentend.

This is from the MSDN, a specific use case they site
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I like the analogy from the JSIS descripton, THIS is essentially a key word that references back to function/area the variable is being called.  Similar to a pronun refering back to a person in a sentance.

It might be more specific to avoid using this, but as the code/objects got complicated THIS key words could avoid writing long strings to call variables from inside objects
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It sets control the value of variablies/proprites between object based on their creation.
