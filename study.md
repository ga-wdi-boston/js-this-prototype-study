(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I learned that we use 'this' as a shortcut to refer to an object. In this way, it
can executive the object's code. This is important so our code remains clean and
unambiguous, as well as to prevent debuging errors in the future. Among the three
links, the most helpful one to me in order to answer this question, was the
javascriptissexy one: http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a referent of an object used inside a function or a mentjhod, or outside
a function in the global scope. If used in strict mode, it is undefined for global
functions. Also, 'this' has an unassigned value until an object invokes the function
function where 'this' is defined. The most helpful link in order to answer this
question, was the javascriptissexy one: http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/

```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
There are 2 concepts with prototype in JavaScript: Prototype property refers to
when a variable defined in a function is implemented with inheritance by adding
methods and properties on a function's protoptype property, in order to make
them ready for that specific function. Secondly, the prototype attribute/object
is all about 'lineage': every object receives properties and methods from some
other object (its parent).
