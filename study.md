## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason to use 'this' is it will save time when your are writing functions similar to the way using pronouns saves
time while writing English (analogy from JS is sexy).  If you want to write a function that could be used on many
variables, you don't want to have to specifically name the particalar variable each time and write essentially the same
function over and over again.  There are several examples from the 'this' write up from Mozilla.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is a JavaScript keyword that acts as a referent and holds the value of an object. It is essentially the pronoun
of the JavaScript language.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype can be both a property of a function and the attribute of an object. They help tell us where objects and
functions inherit their characteristics from. One way prototypes help us do less work is by automatically keeping
methods and properties of functions attached to later instances of a function.  Another way prototypes are helpful is
telling us where objects inherit their properties from.
