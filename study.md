# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
According the the blog post linked in the readme, "this" is used for aesthetic reasons but primarily is used to avoid scope errors because variables might have the same names
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a property of objects that, while it behaves in a number of different ways depending on context, is used by a function to reference the object it is a part of. (Source: MDN)
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is essentially a generic version of an object which can be used to more quickly construct new objects that share a number of properties.

It also allows for methods to be defined and passed to all objects created from that prototype, rather than rewriting the method each time.
```
