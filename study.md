## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" allows us to referece the object without know what the object is. If we
would use the button.click function the "this" would have reference to the object
that was clicked on and we could use the object without knowing its name.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" could be used to reference the object that created the "this" method. The
use of "this" is simular to the use of pronouns in a sentence. It makes our code
less ambiguous and more precise.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
prototype is the inheritance of the creator object's methods and attributes.  you
can access a function on your object that is not explicitly defined as long as
it is defined on a parent object up the chain.
