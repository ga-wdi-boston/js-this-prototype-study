## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a keyword that signifies using a property whose value is determined within any current object.  This can be used in a function outside of an object that is then called within an object, or used as a method in a property and then used in a different property of that object or even another object, and the keyword will signify the new object.

sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.
