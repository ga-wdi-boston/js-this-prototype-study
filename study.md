(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" is versatile.  It can be used as a variable refering to the object that is being used or as referred to in [MDN:This], it refers to the antecedant object just as a pronoun refers to a antecedant subject.

It comes in handy when you don't know the exact value / name of an object or if you want to be able to refer to different objects. so you can use the global "this" term and have it apply to whatever object youre working on/in with each referece.

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" is a special specific case of a global variable that stores an object and all of its values and data. It is a placeholder where you an input any object later.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
prototype is a built in function/property that says:

A.prototype.B = xxxxx
add to object A, all of B which = xxxxx.

or if in the formate

A.prototype = B

add to object A, everything associated with B.

A more technical and formal term for this is inheritance. Objects have the ability to inherity functions and properties from other objects. [JSIS: prototype]

```
