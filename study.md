# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use the word 'this' to take the place of re-typing the name of the object (programmers are lazy....) that is being used.  It saves time because it's a shortcut and your code will still work provided you use the word correctly.  (you're not getting Chicago-style references from me...  Got this info from http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it and from http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html)
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'This' takes the place of the name of an object that is being referred to when we're using a method on it.  It substitutes the name of the object, function, or array, when used within the specific object.  If it's used outside of the object and it hasn't been declared as a variable, it will refer to a global variable (or you could have a scoping issue).
Got this sweet info from http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it and the MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is a model of an object that can give it's properties and methods to other objects.  It serves well in object oriented programming because you don't have to re-type the properties and methods of a prototype when you create a new object.  It saves time when programming and you have DRY code.

I took a couple of C++ classes last year, so that's a source of information, as well as http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/ for review.
