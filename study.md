# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use 'this' to make references to other methods within an object When we are inside an object and want to make use of a method or function that have already been declared within it. I used the MDN and javascriptissexy material to come to this understanding.

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'This' is nothing more than a reference. By itself it means nothing, but it provides context by letting the object know it is making a reference to itself. When 'this' is referring to something, 'this' means the object itself. It is like an object is able to speak in the first person.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is essentially an empty function. We are able to add methods and properties to the prototype and those methods and properties then become available through inheritance by other future objects that use constructors, which are just references to the original prototype.
Protoypes exist to allow the sharing of methods and properites between different objects.
I used the protoype article on javascriptissexy.com.
