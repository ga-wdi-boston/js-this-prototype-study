# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use this as a sort of place holder which saves us enormous amounts of time and allows for things such as inheritence and object construction. It makes for less, more percise code.
(Sources = The three readings and what I can recall from codeacademy lessons.)

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This acts as a place holder for an object. It allows for specific assignment of different attributes and helps facilitate things such as inheritence.
(Same sources)
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is a way in which to apply methods and attributes to object constructors higher in the constructor chain. It allows for altering the way inheritence works with each invokation of .prototype and allows for the creation of custom methods.
(Same sources)
```
