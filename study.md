## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

We could use "this" to prevent  confusion as to whether we are referring to a global variable or
if we are referring to an object value.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype property exists for each and every function within javaScript (although it's value is empty by default).  It is used for inheritance and so that other methods can use these inherited properties indicated by the prototype (e.g. within instances of a function).
