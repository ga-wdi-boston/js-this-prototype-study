## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is dynamic in its use in that it can take on many different values while also, because of its versatility, allows users to be more specific in using an object once it has invoked a function.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is...for lack of a better term off the top of my head, a placeholder for an object literal called within the body of a function. In one set of declared objects assigned to a given variable, this can refer to 'homeWork: 1', while this can also refer to 'homeWork: 2', if that makes sense. Once a object is called upon, this can be used.

This's use varys depending on the context(global or local use).

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototype has numerous uses, however its key uses are (1) to allow for the inheritance of methods assigned to one variable used in a function to the next function said variabnle is used in. (2) to locate inherited properties of a given object.

So essentially, prototype is the original object literal from which its children objects are granted their methods from.
