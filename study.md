# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
(NOTE: For all answers, I used the assigned readings and google, and found javascriptissexy.com to be very helpful.)

I'm not quite sure about when we use "this," but I believe it is when you want to continually reassign (or invoke) the previous object returned in a function. I think a common example would be when you are writing a function for clicking on a button in a website.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use 'this' as a referent, similar to the way we use pronouns in English: it refers to an object we have mentioned earlier. For example, we would say "Lauren is speeding because SHE is late," using the pronoun SHE, instead of "Lauren is speeding because LAUREN" is late. In this sentence, the pronoun 'she' functions similarly to 'this' in JavaScript.



```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I found a very simple answer here (https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/understanding-javascript-prototypes/)

According to this site, a prototype is simply "an object from which other objects inherit properties". I believe another way to say this would be that a prototype is a way of adding custom properties or methods to objects.
