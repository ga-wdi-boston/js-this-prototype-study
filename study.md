## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One of the reason we use "this" keyword is when we want to refer to an object that is bounded to the function that uses "this".

It holds a value of an object, but that value is only assigned when that object invokes the function that uses "this". That object that invokes the function is called  the "context".

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" can be used either within a function or method or it can be used globally when used outside of the function or method.

If "this" is used within a function, it always refers to an object that holds the function that uses "this". When it is used outside of a function, it always referes to the global window object.

```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Every function in JavaScript has prototype property (empty by default).

Assigning prototype property to a function allows us to assing other properties and methods that we can use on different objects later on without specifically assigning the same properties and methods on those new created objects.
