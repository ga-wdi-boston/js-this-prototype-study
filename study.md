-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
So, this is important because it eliminates calling out function subjects
multiple times (overlapping times) in a single document.  Where there may be
functions written for several things all called 'height'.  'This' would refer
to the specific 'height' within the function that it is contained within.
I think.  It's confusing.  From what I'm understanding, 'this' is just a
placeholder, may be used multiple times (as long as it's contained) and can even
be used multiple times within one function to describe seperate attributes of that function, again, so long as it is contained and labeled spefically.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'This' is a placeholder, refering back to the object that you are writing a
function for and is specifically used to name attributes of that object.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Huh.  Prototype was even more confusing.  I'm reading this as a 'prototype' is
like a baseline object.  As in it's a way to have certain characteristics
already be present in an object without writing those characteristics in
yourself.  So....it's like saying we have a car.  Cars have wheels, doors etc.
But what does OUR CAR have?  That's up to us and we'll define that in the objects attributes.  ??  Yes?
