## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
According the the blog post linked in the readme, "this" is used for aesthetic reasons but primarily is used to avoid scope errors because variables might have the same names
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a property of objects that, while it behaves in a number of different ways depending on context, is used by a function to reference the object it is a part of. (Source: MDN)
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is essentially a generic version of an object which can be used to more quickly construct new objects that share a number of properties.

It also allows for methods to be defined and passed to all objects created from that prototype, rather than rewriting the method each time.
```
