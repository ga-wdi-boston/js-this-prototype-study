## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
There are two reasons. One is as a shortcut, and the other is that in certain situations
it provides more clarity about what object a method is referencing.  This is what
I got from the reading.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It is a shorthand placeholder for referncing an object within a method.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I didn't completely follow the readings, but my understanding it that it has something
to do with inheritance.  Each object starts off with a prototype property that it
inherits from the object that created it.
```
