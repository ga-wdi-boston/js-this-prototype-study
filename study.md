# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- We use `this` as a placeholder for an object that prompts a function to help clarify which object we want based on contextual evidence. ["JSIS: This" helped me understand a little better.]-->
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- `this` is something we throw into code to signify an object when we want to avoid repetition, redundancy, or confusion. The object may or may not be global, and when `this` is either outside a function or holds no relevance in a function, its object defaults to global, e.g. the window of a web browser. That said, if we have context of a function then `this` becomes bound to an object that makes the function happen. If the context changes, then `this` becomes reassigned accordingly. ['JSIS: This' and 'MDN: This']-->
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!--A prototype is parent code from which an object can inherit properties and methods... objects with prototypes can have the same properties as the prototypes without needing to copy the code from the parent... saves time and lines thanks to a chain/family of code [JSIS: Prototype]-->
```
