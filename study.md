## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'This' allows for code to be neater and can also make functions reusable. This
will change depending on how and where the function is called.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'This' works similar to pronouns in everyday speech. It calls back the object which
was previously defined. If it's not used in a function, 'this' refers to the document.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
prototypes are like the parents of any object. Every object has a protype
which it is given and inherits from however you can set a new protype for
any object. 
```
