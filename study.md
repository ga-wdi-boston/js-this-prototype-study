## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
The main reason I have used this up to point in my studies has been in methods in objects which alter properties of said object. For example, in the television object, the only way to shift the volume up or down was to invoke them via this.volume.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I think the post from javascript is sexy does a good job explaining what this is: basically javascript's equivalent of a pronoun. My personal knowledge of this is colored by my past experience with java, where this is basically used in objects in instances of self-reference.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototype is how javascript handles inheritence. Prototype basically takes the role of super in java, and anything denoted after a prototype call is a subtype. Prototype seems fairly mutable, and can be used on objects, methods or properties, in line with javascript's fairly flexible nature.
