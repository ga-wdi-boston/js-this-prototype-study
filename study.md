# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
After reading, and then re-reading the 'MDN: This' link I have reached this
conclusion.

One reason we use 'this' is if we were to use a function as a constructor.
Inside the constructor we could use 'this' to stand in for the future variable
name. When we create a new variable utilizing the constructor we built
previously the 'this' will refer to our new variable so we don't have to change
the body of the function every time we call it.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I used the javscriptissexy.com link as well as
sitepoint.com/what-is-this-in-javascript to help me understand the concept of
'this' in javascript.

In my words 'this' is a fluid way to refer to the object that the function you
are in resides inside of.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I have completed the free JavaScript course on codecademy.com and read through
the javascriptissexy.com link provided to shed some light on prototypes.

A prototype is a way to share inheritance with other functions. All functions
have a .prototype value that they inherit from. We can control these inherited
properties with constructors.
```
