## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason we use "this" is because it allows us to reference something in different contexts. I see this as being useful in that it can eliminate some human error and make code easier to debug.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is a keyword that is difficult to grasp and understand but also can be extremely useful.
"This" is a way to refer to an object but can also be an object itself if used outside of a function. "This" always refers to an object.

"This" (or value of "this") within an object IS that object.
"This" in a function is whatever object that function lives within. Sometimes that object is the global object. Other times it's a local object.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A prototype is something every object in JS has. (http://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/02/22/a-plain-english-guide-to-javascript-prototypes/)

A prototype is comprised of two concepts that are interrelated. One of those is a "prototype property" and one of those is a "prototype attribute".
The "property" is inherently empty but its existence allows us to "put on" or assign(?) inheritance?
Ther "prototype attribute" is essentially the parent object from which an object inherits properties.
