# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
We use the keyword "this" as a shortcut to refer to the object we're currently in. We use 'this' to avoid being repetitive in our code too. It also contains the value of the object that it is enclosed in, so by using 'this', we avoid typing out the entire thing.
The most helpful article was the second one at this link "http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/"
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
The keyword 'this' is a way of writing cleaner, less repetitive code. 'This' is a shortcut to refer to the object we are working on without typing out entire objects, if they have things assigned to them, this would be messy, without 'this'(pun)
When a function executes, it gets the 'this' property. The 'this' property always refers to an object.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
For Prototype, there are two concepts that use it.
-Every JS function has a 'prototype property', it is empty by default. You attach properties and methods to this 'prototype property' to implement inheritance: "to make them useful in instances of that function", essentially save them or make them available.
-An objects 'prototype attribute' points us to the parent of that object(the object it inherited its properties from). It can also be refered to as the 'prototype object'
for these responses, i used the third article , "http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/"
and the one that it linked, teaching about objects, here:
"http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-objects-in-detail/"
```
