## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
< we would use 'this' as a shortcut when coding a function/method in an object
so that we can invoke the object.

I used the javascript is sexy site to find this information.
 -->
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
'this' is used as a shortcut to refer to an object and also contains the value
of an object. it is typically used inside of a function or a method. On a
global scale, it makes code more unambiguous, meaning that there will be less
bugs in the long run.

I retrieved/retained most of the information about "this" from the
javascript is sexy website. I feel that it explained the concepts better.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- Prototypes are the way that objects inherit features from one another.
Those features can be properties and methods. They can include prototype objects
which start a prototype chain. These chains explain why different objects have
features that are defined on OTHER objects that are available to them.

I got this information from both the mozilla and javascript is sexy sites.
I also referenced the notes that I took from the readings.-->
