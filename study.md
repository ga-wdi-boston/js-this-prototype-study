## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
I would say "this" is a reference to something and is better explained
what "this" does depending on context.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" is a keyword that refers to a current object and also contains the value of the object. From my understanding "this" is a shortcut that can be used to reference back to the current object within
context. Because "this" doesn't have an assigned value until the object invokes
the function where "this" is defined.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototype is a property for functions that you can attach properties and methods
to. Doing that will let you implement inheritance, you can then add methods
and properties on a function's prototype property to make those methods and
properties available to instances of that function. Prototype is also an
attribute. Prototype, generally, shows the properties of an object or shows
its parent object making it available to access.
