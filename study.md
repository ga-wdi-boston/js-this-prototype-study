## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" can be used to reference or call a function earlier defined, as long as it part of that function's expression. 'this' will always refer to an object within the same fucntion, unless used globally, in which case it refers to the global object`[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this]
```

sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It sounds like the 'prototype' is like an pre-existing characteristic of an object in an expression. (honestly idk, the reading refers to constructors and
