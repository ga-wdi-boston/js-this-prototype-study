# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This in context works similarly in the English Language. It refers to the antecendent
in a sentence or in this case for programming(the Object). Thus, when using the "this"
keyword it will work if you are referring to the object in relation to it(within the objects function or method). We use "this" because it prevents developers from calling a variable that may have been used within the global scope of the program and returning an incorrect property. The relevant source that I used for this is from Js.issexy

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is a shortcut that refers to an object when it is called upon. When used in an object, it "becomes" the object. When used in a function, it takes the code as if it were the object. It\'s not a varaible.
The information here is from W3School.com and Js.issexy

```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
The prototype in my sense of understanding is like the bare bones of an Object. It comes with standard/default
properties and a developer can build upon that prototype to have more features (properties and attributes) to create a dynamic object that can be inherited for future objects. Information I used was from W3School and Js.issexy.
