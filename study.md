## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is used to refer to the antecedent of the object in context, much like pronouns in English. 'this' is essentially used as a shortcut to refer back to the object in context.

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototypes are used to implement inheritance from other objects. We can add methods and properties on a function's prototype in order to make those methods and properties available to future iterations of the function it is associated with.
