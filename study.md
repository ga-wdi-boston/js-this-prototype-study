## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
There are two concepts we need to look at: prototype property (used for inheritance meaning adding methods and functions on a prototype property to make those available) and prototype attribute (more of a characterisitic of the object). Objects created from object literals and object constructor inherit from the Object.constructor. In short, a property is a variable defined on a function.
