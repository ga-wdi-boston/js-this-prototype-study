## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This is a refferential object reference. Essentially we're using it as a substitute for something that's already been called. "We use this similar to the way we use pronouns in natural languages like English and French. We write, â€œJohn is running fast because he is trying to catch the train." http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Prototypes are like the core inherent values of an object. It's like the dna that's passed on to objects that are of the same species. http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/
