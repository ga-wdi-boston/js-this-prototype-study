## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
One reason why we use "this" is for precision. It can be used as a shortcut to refer to the current object in context.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"This" is essentially just a substitute for the object in question similar to the way pronouns are used in the English language.
It helps to quickly refer back to the object and is typically nested within a function.
I used the "Understand JavaScript’s “this” With Clarity, and Master It" article, which best helped me understand the concept.
```

## A Prototype is what

In your own words explain what a prototype is.  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
This concept is still very blurry to me, but I THINK prototypes is the idea that objects get properties and attributes from other objects which can be assigned.
I will read into this further tonight after my grad school class but wanted to submit something before I left GA for the day.

```
