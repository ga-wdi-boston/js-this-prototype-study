# This and Prototype Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [MDN: This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(only up to and including the "As a Constructor" section).
-   [JSIS: This](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/)
-   [MDN: Prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
-   [JSIS: Prototype](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It makes the code clearer. When used inside of an object, it makes it clear that you are referring to the specific object that "this" is inside of rather than some other global object or variable that might have the same name. I used the JSIS reading for this answer.
```

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
In the JSIS reading, I learned that "this" is used to refer to an object. The object that it is referring to is different based on where the reference is located and how it is invoked.
```

## A Prototype is what
Based on the provided readings, it appears that a prototype is an object that other objects and functions can inherit properties and methods from. Each time a new object is created that inherits from a protoype object, then a prototype chain is created that
shows how the inheritance occurred.
