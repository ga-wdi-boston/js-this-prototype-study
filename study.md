## This in Context

In your own words, explain one reason why we use "this". In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

## This is what

In your own words explain "this".  In your answer, be
sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
"this" is like a pronoun and is used to refer to an object rather than calling the object name. Using "this" makes it clear that code is referring to a particular object in order to provide context and make it easier to understand code when
reading it.
